// Car Rental Services
// A car rental service charges a minimum fee of $25.00 to rent a car for
// 8 hours, and charges an additional $5 per hour after 8 hours. The maximum charge per day is $50
// exclusive of service tax. The company charges an additional $0.50 per hour as service tax. Assume that
// no car is rented for more than 72 hours at a time. If a car is rented for more than 24 hours, then rental
// is calculated on a daily basis. Write a program that calculates and prints the rental charges for each of
// three customers who rented cars from this agency yesterday. You should enter the hours for which the
// car has been rented for each customer. Your program should print the results in a neat tabular format
// and should calculate and print the total of yesterdayâ€™s receipts. The program should use the function
// calculateCharges to determine the charges for each customer. Your outputs should appear in the
// following format

#include <stdio.h>
